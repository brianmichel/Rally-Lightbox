Rally Lightbox Safari Extension 
================================

This extension is to add lightbox support to the Rally project management website. I was *SO* sick of having to download images from defects/stories that I added my own lightbox support. Special thanks to [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) and [Fancybox](http://www.fancybox.net) for providing me the nice tools to make this happen.
